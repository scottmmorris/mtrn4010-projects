% Code below adopted from example code by Dr. Guivant.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%5
% DemoEKF.m - version 2017.1
% MRTN4010 - S1.2016
% Example using Extended Kalman Filter for the localization problem, using laser range observations.

% Note#1:
% For each "laser scan" we extract the detected landmarks and use their ranges to update the estimated 
% states (3DoF: 2D position and heading of the platform).  
% Even frequently using "just" one range (related to some landmark) the estimator is
% able to estimate the pose (position and heading)!!!
% Q: How is this possible?
% A: This is because in addition to the observation model we use the process model (which correlates the states in time) as well.
% As the robot moves then we obtain several observations from different poses (and at different times).
% This system is what is said to be "Observable" 
% (its internal states can be estimated by observing its "outputs", in this case we measure the robot's distance to certain landmark/landmarks).


% Note#2: in this simulation we run the process model at certain frequency
% (dt=50ms), however we do not assume we get measurements (for the observations) at that sample
% rate (that situation would be great!, but it is not always possible). We assume observations have a slower sample rate. This
% is to show that even for a poor system (observing at low rate) the estimation process is still good and feasible. 
% ( Question: How fast is a human driver in observing the context in order to estimate his/her pose? )


%Note #3:
% You can change many things in this simulation:
% 1)  the geographical distribution and number of landmarks.
% 2)  the noise's standard deviations in the inputs of the kinematic model of the vehicle
% 3)  the noise's standard deviations of range measurements
% 4)  the sampling rate of the scanner
% 5)  the inputs to the process (speed and angular rate)
% and a lot of things for experimenting!


% You are requested, in Project01, to 
%  1) modify the update stage of the EKF for accepting bearing observations.
%  2) Adapt the Q matrix used in the prediction step, for properly
%  considering the noise that pollutes the model inputs.



% Note4:  IMPORTANT
% a) You will need to modify the EKF update stage in order to deal with the
% cases:        Bearing Only and Range+Bearing (as required in Project01).

% b) you need to adapt the Q matrix in the prediction stage, in order to
% consider the noise that pollutes the inputs of the process model (speed
% and gyroZ). Follow the approach presented in the lecture notes, in file
% "MTRN4010_L06_Noise_in_the_inputs_of_ProcessModel.pdf"

%---------------------------------

% In this problem we have a kinematic model of the platform ( our "process
% model"). The inputs, u(t), of the model are 2 :
%    a)  platform's speed (measured at the middle point between the back wheels) 
%    b)  Wz (yaw/heading angular rate), measured through  IMU's gyros.

% Here I define the magnitude of the "noises", which I assume are present, 
% polluting mesurements, models, etc.  

% Standard deviation of the error in the angular rate sensor. 
stdDevGyro = 2*pi/180 ;        
% 2 degrees/second , standard deviation of the gyros' noise
% you have seen, when playing with our real IMU's data that, after removing the
% offsets, the random error present in the gyros' measurements should be lower than 2 deg/sec.


% Standard deviation of the error in the speed's measurements
stdDevSpeed = 0.15 ;   % We simulate a lot of error!  (very difficult case). 
% Speed meter's error = 0.15m/sec; actually, a low quality speed sensor!

% ... errors in the range measurements (25cm, standard dev.)
sdev_rangeMeasurement = 0.25 ;          % std. of noise in range measurements. 0.25m

% this is more than the error you would have with our laser scanner.

% .....................................................
% Here, I create a virtual map, because this program works on a simulated process.
% (in a real case you would have a real map)

% How many landmarks do you want to use?  
n_usedLanmarks = 4 ;    %it must be : 0 < n_usedLanmarks <5 
% just to create some landmarks
% if you specify "n_usedLanmarks = 0", you would not have observations
% (i.e. no updates, just predictions )

% Some buffers to store the intermediate values during the experiment
Xreal_History= zeros(3,Li) ;
Xe_History= zeros(3,Li) ;

% .....................................................
% I assume that every time we apply the process model to predict the evolution of the system for a 
% perdiod of time of Dt (50ms) we introduce uncertainty of 0.01m standard deviation on X, 
% similar uncertainty on Y and 1 degree (a lot!) on the heading's estimation

% "MTRN40101_L06_Noise_in_the_inputs_of_ProcessModel.pdf" in order to implement a good refinement.
